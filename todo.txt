√ write code to project Blatteinteilung onto an SVG sheet:
  √ read JSON and project
  √ write SVG
  √ parse CRS from GeoJSON
√ write code to de-project an SVG sheet to geojson:
  √ parse lines from SVG
  √ de-project lines
  √ write lines to geojson
  √ extend to support rect+line
  √ parse CRS from SVG
  - extend to support paths (low priority)
  - extend to support transformations (low priority)
√ extend to support point features (for soundings)
- CLI
- extend to support compound paths <=> hole polygons / MultiLineStrings (low priority)
